I learnt lots of new stuffs.

* How to calculate precision and recall, when facing 2 or more than 2 categories.
* Reversals after turn are almost all forward because of wrong head-tail-recognition. (But I won't change it, because it is advantageous for our taxis project, by guaranteeing the high precision of forwards.)
* Behavior classification can not be 100% objective.

Why I didn't do this in 2023-05 or 2023-09? Because I didn't figure out how to avoid the subjectivity of behavior classification. Now I use the total-agree-method.
